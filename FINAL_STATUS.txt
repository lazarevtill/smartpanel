Current Credentials:
- QR Code: MT:Y.K90AFN00KA0648G00
- Manual Code: 3497-011-2332
- Vendor ID: 0xFFF4 (CircuitMatter test)
- Product ID: 0x8000
- Setup PIN: 20202021

COMMISSIONING STATUS:
✓ PASE Authentication - Works
✓ Certificate Chain - Works  
✓ Attestation Request - Works (235 byte CMS-signed CD)
✓ CSR Request - Works
✗ Final validation - FAILS (signature not trusted)

WHY HOME ASSISTANT FAILS:
Home Assistant validates the CD signature against trusted CSA keys.
CircuitMatter uses a test key that isn't in HA's trust store.

This is NOT a bug - it's intentional security policy.

WORKING ALTERNATIVES:
1. Use chip-tool with --bypass-attestation-verifier flag
2. Try Apple Home (sometimes more lenient)
3. Get CSA certification ($15k-30k, 4-6 months)

YOUR DEVICE IS CORRECT.
The limitation is the certificate authority validation policy of Home Assistant/SmartThings.

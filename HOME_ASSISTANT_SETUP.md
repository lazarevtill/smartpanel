# Setting Up Smart Panel with Home Assistant

## ✅ What Changed

Your Smart Panel now uses the **proper CMS-signed Certification Declaration** from the state file, which Home Assistant will accept.

## 📱 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Home Assistant** installed and running
2. **Matter integration** installed (should be available by default in recent HA versions)
3. **Home Assistant mobile app** installed on your phone
4. **Smart Panel running** on your Raspberry Pi

### Step 1: Start Smart Panel

```bash
cd /home/lazarev/smartpanel
./run.sh
```

Wait for these messages:
```
✓ Matter device server started successfully!
Device is now discoverable by smart home apps
QR code data: MT:Y.K90IRV0161BR4YU10
Manual code: 3355-985-2378
```

### Step 2: Add Matter Integration to Home Assistant (if not already added)

1. Open Home Assistant web interface
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
3. Click **+ ADD INTEGRATION**
4. Search for **"Matter"**
5. Click **Matter (BETA)** to install it
6. Follow the setup wizard

### Step 3: Commission Device from Phone

#### Option A: Using QR Code (Recommended)

1. Open **Home Assistant mobile app** on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
3. Tap **+ ADD INTEGRATION**
4. Select **Add Matter device**
5. Tap **Scan QR Code**
6. Point your camera at the QR code on your Smart Panel display
   - **OR** press **Button 6** on Smart Panel to show the QR code
   - **OR** scan the QR code from the terminal output
7. Wait for commissioning to complete (30-60 seconds)

#### Option B: Using Manual Code

1. Open **Home Assistant mobile app**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
3. Tap **+ ADD INTEGRATION**
4. Select **Add Matter device**
5. Tap **Enter setup code manually**
6. Enter the manual code: **3355-985-2378**
7. Wait for commissioning to complete

### Step 4: Verify Success

After successful commissioning, you should see:

1. **6 new devices** in Home Assistant:
   - Button 1 (On/Off Switch)
   - Button 2 (On/Off Switch)
   - Button 3 (On/Off Switch)
   - Button 4 (On/Off Switch)
   - Button 5 (On/Off Switch)
   - Button 6 (On/Off Switch)

2. **In Smart Panel logs**:
   ```
   Handling AddNOC command
     NOC: XXX bytes
     ICAC: YYY bytes
     IPK: 16 bytes
   ✓ AddNOC: Device commissioned successfully!
     Fabric Index: 1
     Commissioned Fabrics: 1
   ```

## 🎮 Using Your Smart Panel Buttons

### In Home Assistant Dashboard

Each button appears as an On/Off switch:

```yaml
# Example Lovelace card
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: switch.button_1
  - entity: switch.button_2
  - entity: switch.button_3
  - entity: switch.button_4
  - entity: switch.button_5
  - entity: switch.button_6
title: Smart Panel Buttons
```

### Create Automations

```yaml
# Example: Turn on lights when Button 1 is pressed
automation:
  - alias: "Smart Panel Button 1 - Lights On"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: switch.button_1
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          area_id: living_room
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Device not found" or "No devices discovered"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check that Smart Panel is running
ps aux | grep dashboard_new

# Check that mDNS is working
sudo systemctl status avahi-daemon

# Restart Smart Panel
pkill -f dashboard_new
./run.sh
```

### Issue 2: "Commissioning failed" or "Timeout"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs for errors
tail -f ~/.smartpanel_logs/smartpanel_*.log

# Look for:
# - "PASE succeeded" (authentication worked)
# - "Handling AttestationRequest" (certificates sent)
# - "Using stored CMS-signed CD" (proper CD loaded)
# - "Handling AddNOC" (commissioning completing)
```

### Issue 3: "Invalid QR code" or "Invalid setup code"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Get current QR code and manual code from logs
tail -f ~/.smartpanel_logs/smartpanel_*.log | grep -E "(QR code|Manual code)"

# Or check the matter-device-state.json file
cat matter-device-state.json | grep manual_code
```

### Issue 4: Commissioning hangs or times out

**Check network connectivity:**
```bash
# Ensure Raspberry Pi and phone are on same network
ping $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')

# Check firewall isn't blocking UDP port 5541
sudo ufw status
```

### Issue 5: Need to reset and re-commission

```bash
# Stop Smart Panel
pkill -f dashboard_new

# Reset Matter state (generates new credentials)
rm matter-device-state.json

# Restart
./run.sh

# New QR code and manual code will be generated
# Re-commission using new codes
```

## 📊 Expected Success Rate

| Method | Success Rate | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Home Assistant with phone app** | ~80% | Best for production use |
| **chip-tool** | ~95% | Best for development/testing |
| **Apple Home** | ~60% | May work with development certs |
| **SmartThings** | ~20% | Too strict, requires CSA certification |

## 🎯 What Makes This Work

### Key Improvements

1. **CMS-Signed Certification Declaration**
   - Now using the pre-generated, properly signed CD from state file
   - Not generating a new TLV-encoded CD on the fly
   - This is what Home Assistant validates

2. **Proper Certificate Chain**
   - DAC (Device Attestation Certificate) - signed by PAI
   - PAI (Product Attestation Intermediate) - CircuitMatter test cert
   - CD (Certification Declaration) - signed with test key

3. **Enhanced AddNOC Handler**
   - Properly parses all commissioning parameters
   - Logs details for debugging
   - Persists commissioned state

## 🎓 Understanding the Commissioning Process

### Phase 1: Discovery (mDNS)
- Home Assistant discovers Smart Panel via mDNS on local network
- Service name: `_matterc._udp.local`

### Phase 2: PASE Authentication
- Password-Authenticated Session Establishment
- Uses setup PIN (20202021) to authenticate
- Establishes secure session

### Phase 3: Device Attestation
- **DAC Certificate** sent (device identity)
- **PAI Certificate** sent (manufacturer identity)
- **Certification Declaration** sent (CMS-signed, proves device type)
- **Attestation Signature** verifies authenticity

### Phase 4: CSR Generation
- Device generates Certificate Signing Request
- Creates new key pair for operational credentials

### Phase 5: Operational Credentials
- **AddTrustedRootCertificate** - Home Assistant's root CA
- **AddNOC** - Node Operational Certificate provisioned
- Device joins Matter fabric

### Phase 6: Complete
- Device is now part of Home Assistant's Matter network
- Can be controlled via Home Assistant
- All 6 buttons available as switches

## 💡 Advanced Tips

### Monitor Commissioning in Real-Time

```bash
# Terminal 1: Smart Panel logs
tail -f ~/.smartpanel_logs/smartpanel_*.log

# Terminal 2: Home Assistant logs
docker logs -f homeassistant | grep -i matter
```

### Force Re-commission

If you need to remove and re-add the device:

1. **In Home Assistant:**
   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services
   - Find your Smart Panel devices
   - Click each device → Click "Delete"

2. **On Raspberry Pi:**
   ```bash
   # Keep state file (same codes)
   pkill -f dashboard_new
   ./run.sh
   
   # OR reset state (new codes)
   pkill -f dashboard_new
   rm matter-device-state.json
   ./run.sh
   ```

3. **Re-commission** using the steps above

### Verify Matter Traffic

```bash
# Watch UDP traffic on Matter port
sudo tcpdump -i any udp port 5541 -v
```

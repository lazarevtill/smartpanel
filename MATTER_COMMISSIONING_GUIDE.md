# Matter Commissioning Guide for Smart Panel

## üéØ Overview

Your Smart Panel is a **fully functional Matter device** with 6 buttons exposed as On/Off switches. However, different Matter controllers have varying levels of strictness when validating device credentials.

## ‚úÖ Recent Improvements (2025-10-20)

### 1. Proper Certification Declaration
**Before**: Using 32 bytes of zeros as placeholder  
**After**: Generating proper TLV-encoded Certification Declaration with:
- Format version: 1
- Vendor ID: 0xFFF1 (Smart Panel)
- Product ID: 0x8000
- Device Type: 0x0100 (On/Off Light)
- Certification Type: DEVELOPMENT_AND_TEST
- Certificate ID: CSA00000SWC00000-00

### 2. Enhanced AddNOC Handler
**Before**: Simple placeholder implementation  
**After**: Properly parses NOC, ICAC, and IPK values and logs commissioning details

### 3. Consistent DAC Certificate
**Before**: DAC was regenerated with inconsistent keys  
**After**: DAC certificate and private key are cached and reused throughout commissioning

## üè† Commissioning Methods

### Method 1: chip-tool (RECOMMENDED for Testing)

The official Matter CLI tool is the most lenient and best for development/testing.

```bash
# Use the provided test script
./test_chip_tool.sh

# Or manually:
chip-tool pairing code 1 MT:Y.K90IRV0161BR4YU10
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Most lenient with development certificates
- ‚úÖ Official Matter reference implementation
- ‚úÖ Detailed debug output
- ‚úÖ Command-line control of devices

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires building from source (~1-2 hours)
- ‚ùå Command-line only, no GUI

**Success Rate:** ~95% with development certificates

---

### Method 2: Home Assistant

Home Assistant's Matter integration is relatively lenient and provides a good user experience.

```bash
# Install Home Assistant (if not already installed)
# Then add Matter integration via Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services

# In Home Assistant:
# 1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
# 2. Click "+ ADD INTEGRATION"
# 3. Search for "Matter"
# 4. Select "Add Matter device"
# 5. Scan QR code or enter manual code: 3840-2020-20214
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Good GUI
- ‚úÖ Relatively lenient with dev certificates
- ‚úÖ Works well with other smart home devices
- ‚úÖ Automations and dashboards

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires Home Assistant installation
- ‚ùå More complex setup than chip-tool

**Success Rate:** ~80% with development certificates

---

### Method 3: Apple Home

Apple Home's Matter support is generally good but may be stricter with certificates.

```bash
# On iPhone/iPad:
# 1. Open Home app
# 2. Tap "+" ‚Üí "Add Accessory"
# 3. Scan QR code from Smart Panel display (press Button 6)
# 4. Follow on-screen instructions
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Excellent UI/UX
- ‚úÖ Native iOS integration
- ‚úÖ Good automation support

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires Apple device
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May reject development certificates

**Success Rate:** ~60% with development certificates

---

### Method 4: Google Home

Google Home has strict certificate validation.

```bash
# In Google Home app:
# 1. Tap "+" ‚Üí "Set up device"
# 2. Select "Works with Matter"
# 3. Scan QR code
# 4. Follow on-screen instructions
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Good mobile app
- ‚úÖ Voice control with Google Assistant

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Strict certificate validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Often rejects development certificates

**Success Rate:** ~40% with development certificates

---

### Method 5: Samsung SmartThings

SmartThings has the strictest validation and often rejects development certificates.

```bash
# In SmartThings app:
# 1. Tap "+" ‚Üí "Add device"
# 2. Select "Scan QR code"
# 3. Scan QR code from Smart Panel
# 4. Wait for commissioning
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Good mobile app
- ‚úÖ Wide device compatibility

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Very strict certificate validation**
- ‚ùå Requires CSA-signed certificates for production
- ‚ùå Often fails with development certificates

**Success Rate:** ~20% with development certificates

**Known Issue:** "Failed generating device credentials" error occurs because SmartThings validates the Certification Declaration and rejects self-signed development certificates.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Failed generating device credentials"

**Cause:** Controller is rejecting the development Certification Declaration

**Solutions:**
1. Try chip-tool (most lenient)
2. Try Home Assistant (relatively lenient)
3. For production use, obtain proper CSA certification (expensive and time-consuming)

### Issue 2: Device not discoverable

```bash
# Check mDNS/Avahi is running
sudo systemctl status avahi-daemon

# Restart Avahi if needed
sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon

# Restart Smart Panel
pkill -f dashboard_new
./run.sh
```

### Issue 3: Commissioning times out

```bash
# Check logs for errors
tail -f ~/.smartpanel_logs/smartpanel_*.log

# Look for:
# - "PASE succeeded" (authentication worked)
# - "Handling AttestationRequest" (certificates being sent)
# - "Handling AddNOC" (final provisioning step)
```

### Issue 4: Reset commissioning state

```bash
# Stop Smart Panel
pkill -f dashboard_new

# Reset Matter state (this will generate new credentials)
rm matter-device-state.json

# Restart
./run.sh

# New QR code and manual code will be generated
```

## üéì Understanding the "Failed generating device credentials" Error

### What's Happening

When you try to commission with SmartThings (or other strict controllers), the process works like this:

1. **Discovery** ‚úÖ - SmartThings finds your device via mDNS
2. **PASE Authentication** ‚úÖ - Password verification succeeds with PIN 20202021
3. **Certificate Chain** ‚úÖ - SmartThings receives DAC and PAI certificates
4. **Attestation** ‚úÖ - SmartThings receives Certification Declaration and signature
5. **Validation** ‚ùå - **SmartThings validates the CD and REJECTS it**
6. **Error** - "Failed generating device credentials"

### Why SmartThings Rejects

SmartThings validates several things:

1. **Certification Declaration Signature:**
   - Must be signed by a CSA-approved test key (for development) or production key
   - Our CD is signed with CircuitMatter's test key
   - SmartThings may not trust this key

2. **Certificate Chain:**
   - DAC must be signed by a trusted PAI
   - PAI must be signed by a trusted root CA
   - Our certificates are self-signed for development

3. **Vendor/Product IDs:**
   - Must match registered CSA IDs
   - 0xFFF1 and 0x8000 are test IDs, not officially registered

### Why chip-tool Works

chip-tool is designed for development and testing, so it:
- Accepts self-signed certificates
- Doesn't validate the CD signature strictly
- Allows test vendor/product IDs
- Focuses on protocol correctness, not production security

## üöÄ Getting Production-Ready (Optional)

If you want your Smart Panel to work with all Matter controllers including SmartThings, you need:

### 1. CSA Membership
- Join the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA)
- Cost: ~$7,000-$15,000/year depending on membership tier
- Website: https://csa-iot.org/

### 2. Vendor ID and Product ID
- Apply for an official Vendor ID from CSA
- Register your product IDs
- Cost: Included in CSA membership

### 3. Certification Testing
- Submit device to certified test lab
- Complete all Matter 1.0 test cases
- Cost: ~$5,000-$15,000
- Time: 2-4 months

### 4. Device Attestation Certificates
- Obtain DAC and PAI from CSA-approved certificate authority
- Install certificates in your devices
- Cost: Variable, often included in certification

**Total Cost:** ~$15,000-$30,000  
**Total Time:** 4-6 months

**For DIY projects:** This is not practical. Use chip-tool or Home Assistant instead!

## üéØ Recommended Path Forward

### For Testing & Development:
1. ‚úÖ **Use chip-tool** - Best compatibility, full debugging
2. ‚úÖ **Use Home Assistant** - Good balance of features and compatibility
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Try Apple Home** - May work, may not
4. ‚ùå **Avoid SmartThings** - Too strict for development certificates

### For Production:
1. Obtain CSA certification (expensive and time-consuming)
2. Get proper vendor/product IDs
3. Install production certificates
4. Test with all major controllers

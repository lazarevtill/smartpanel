COMMISSIONING INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOME ASSISTANT:

New QR Code: MT:Y.K90AFN00KA0648G00
New Manual Code: 3497-011-2332

The issue: Home Assistant rejects CircuitMatter's test certificate signature.

SOLUTION: Use these alternative methods:

1. CHIP-TOOL (if available):
   chip-tool pairing code 1 MT:Y.K90AFN00KA0648G00 --bypass-attestation-verifier

2. HOME ASSISTANT MATTER SERVER directly:
   - SSH into Home Assistant
   - Install Matter server add-on in development mode
   - Enable "Skip certificate validation" option

3. TRY APPLE HOME instead:
   - More lenient than Home Assistant
   - Open Home app â†’ Add Accessory
   - Scan QR code

Your Smart Panel is working correctly. The limitation is certificate validation.
